# Flappy Worm
Based on the Flappy Bird Unity Learn [tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/live-session-making-a-flappy-bird-style-game). Just another clone, but this time with a worm. I highly recomend the tutorial for those who are starting out, it's a nice warm up and back to basics project.
